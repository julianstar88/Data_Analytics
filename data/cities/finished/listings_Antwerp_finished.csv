In the 19th century, Napoleon Bonaparte had the first two docks excavated for an important naval base. This is followed by an intense flowering period in which several other docks will be excavated.<br />In the 20th century the port activities shift to the North. Most people move away and the « Eilandje » is a deserted area between port and city.<br /><br />At the end of the 20th century, one can see the potential of the abandoned docks, quays and warehouses. The city writes, together with the organization ""City on the River"" an international architectural competition and in the early 1990s the Spanish architect Manuel de Solà-Morales draws an initial plan for The Island. In 1997 René Daniel's works out concrete plans for the Old Docks, the Montevideo district and the Cadix district.

In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe’s most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of café-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral.
