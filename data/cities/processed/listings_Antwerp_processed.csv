FLANDERS TODAY a flemish online newspaper has published an article about us and about Airbnb:
“In the last year we’ve had 60 or so guests staying with us at home,” says Fronk, who, with his partner Lieve, is one of the best-rated Flemish hosts on Airbnb, a hotel-like service for the digital age. “We have had guests from Brazil, the US, Canada, Iran, Japan, Bulgaria and more. Though no one from Africa has yet requested to stay.” 
Airbnb is an online marketplace for temporary accommodation across 33,000 cities in 192 countries. Trip planners can find spare rooms, flats, sofa-beds and even igloos and private islands. Some hosts are simply renting out a spare room for a couple of weeks a month to travellers to supplement their incomes or to fill the house when they themselves are away. 
Airbnb is in the vanguard of the so-called “sharing economy”, in which web services help private individuals monetise their possessions and share anything from school runs to electric drills. Flanders has more than 900 listings on the site. 
Connections 
Fronk and Lieve say that their guests have loved Antwerp and always have a good time. Yet if a number of their guests are visiting for tourism, many are in town for less conventional reasons. One was interviewing for a job at the opera house. Another was doing a course with world-famous contemporary artist Jan Fabre, while a third was studying with a leading dancer. A medievalist stayed for several weeks to learn Dutch for her research, while a Canadian rock band crashed when gigging down the road. 
Connecting with new people with different world views is one of the attractions, as is discovering a unexpected shared interest. “The other day I was having a bowl of soup with one of our guests, who had just arrived from the United States,” recalls Fronk. “To our surprise, we soon discovered that we were both working on essays on the same subject.” Fronk, who is a literary translator of Russian and a performer, and Lieve, an organist and soprano, say that in their year of hosting they have yet to have a bad experience. Some guests stay several weeks, some come back for a second or third visit. “But we make it clear on the website that we are vegetarians, that we do yoga and that this is a family house,” Fronk explains. This attracts people who are into the same things (and probably discourages those who want to spend their time exploring Antwerp’s party scene). 
Peer reviews 
Fronk and Lieve live in Borgerhout, a neighbourhood with a large immigrant population just east of the city’s Central Station, which is visible from their balcony. Borgerhout itself does not house many attractions and enjoys a reputation for being a rough sort of place. But guests have never had any problems, says Fronk. Indeed, he wistfully recalls a middle-aged American visitor looking out of the window at the district where Fronk grew up and declaring it a beautiful place. 
Importantly for guests, the area provides easy access by foot or bike to Antwerp’s main sites, including the zoo; elephants can be heard vaguely trumpeting from the flat’s balcony.

Ik probeer me ook thuis op reis te voelen of zoals de Nederlandse schrijver Godfried Bomans, één mijn favoriete schrijvers, het stelde : ” De kunst van te leven is thuis te zijn alsof men op reis is "". Ik hoop dat ik mijn gasten een gevoel van 'thuis zijn'  tijdens hun reis kan geven en hoop jullie snel te mogen verwelkomen en ontmoeten in (Website hidden by Airbnb) kijk er alvast naar uit..

Tengo 29 años y estudio Lengua y Literatura en la Universidad de Amberes y trabajo a medio tiempo en la ciudad. Me encanta el ambiente animado de cada ciudad y trato de disfrutarlo lo más posible con paseos a conciertos en festivales o parques, a través de la moda y las compras, obras de teatro, museos o simplemente pasear por la ciudad. Como soy una persona muy social y que rápidamente hace contactos, la visión de Airbnb es lo mío. Ofrezco un espacio agradable para los viajeros con deseo de explorar, facilito información sobre mi ciudad y establezco algún tipo de interacción sin impertinencia. Viajar de una manera poco convencional e interactuar con la gente local, es algo que los clientes y yo tenemos en común. Después de haber viajado a la ciudad de San Francisco para vivir con una amiga de la infancia, participado en un proyecto intercultural en México, compartido el apartamento de un habitante de Berlín, Valladolid, Barcelona, Viena, y más lugar, hasta trato de hacer unas vacaciones estando en mi casa. Como dice uno de mis escritores Neerlandés favoritos, Godfried Bomans ""el arte de vivir es estar en casa cuando uno está viajando."" Espero darles a mis invitados una sensación de ""hogar"" durante su estancia y espero que pronto pueda darle la bienvenida en Amberes.

我今年 29歲，在UA修語言及文學，同時在安特衛普打工。我喜歡每一個城市的熱鬧氛圍，不管是音樂節，公園演唱會，時尚購物，戲劇表演，博物館，或在市中心散步，我都盡可能找機會品嘗。另外我很樂於交朋友，不管是提供舒適的空間給旅遊愛好者，傳達關於我的城市的資訊，或無壓力的互動，我很理解也能夠發揮Airbnb想表達的精神，畢竟非凡的旅遊方式和與當地人交集是我們的共同點。
我曾去舊金山與兒時的朋友居住，參與過墨西哥的多重文化案子，與他人居住的城市包含柏林，巴拉多利德，巴塞羅那，維也納，等等。在家時我也儘量保持旅遊的心態。我最愛的荷蘭作家『Godfriend Bomans』曾說:『生活的祕訣在於旅遊時也感受到家。』我希望來這裡的客人都有這樣的感受，並期待很快能歡迎您來安特衛普。

Hi everyone,
My name is Christel and this is my story:
I come from the countryside of Belgium. You know...like a small time-stood-still-village where everybody knows everybody :) ? Well, the only way to get out of there once in a while is by going to my favorite city in Belgium, Antwerp.

The City.
I like art, no I mean I LOVE art. Music, theatre, ballet, expositions, literature, performances,...are my sources of inspiration to be creative. I also love  Antwerp is both modern and authentic. It’s a city that moves. There are dozens of cultural activities every week. The food in the restaurants, even in the tiny bars are amazing. It’s ALL about exploring with all your senses. 

About the apartment.
My husband, my kids and I renovated this building a couple of years ago. I prefer to stay there once in a while, having some time for myself. That’s why we decided it to rent it on Airbnb. We’ve chosen for this neighborhood ‘cause it’s the most upcoming place in Antwerp. It’s on a foot walk from the centre and yet it’s different. It’s Antwerps most multicultural neigbourhood. Over 70 different nationalities! And they all have their own cultural traditions which are awesome to discover!

To my guests.
Enjoy your time in Antwerp, they say it's the city of diamonds. 
But for me it's the people who shine :)
Leave a note, a comment or better...a story before you leave. 
I love stories.

Hi everyone,
My name is Christel and this is my story:
I come from the countryside of Belgium. You know...like a small time-stood-still-village where everybody knows everybody :) ? Well, the only way to get out of there once in a while is by going to my favorite city in Belgium, Antwerp.

The City.
I like art, no I mean I LOVE art. Music, theatre, ballet, expositions, literature, performances,...are my sources of inspiration to be creative. I also love  Antwerp is both modern and authentic. It’s a city that moves. There are dozens of cultural activities every week. The food in the restaurants, even in the tiny bars are amazing. It’s ALL about exploring with all your senses. 

About the apartment.
My husband, my kids and I renovated this building a couple of years ago. I prefer to stay there once in a while, having some time for myself. That’s why we decided it to rent it on Airbnb. We’ve chosen for this neighborhood ‘cause it’s the most upcoming place in Antwerp. It’s on a foot walk from the centre and yet it’s different. It’s Antwerps most multicultural neigbourhood. Over 70 different nationalities! And they all have their own cultural traditions which are awesome to discover!

To my guests.
Enjoy your time in Antwerp, they say it's the city of diamonds. 
But for me it's the people who shine :)
Leave a note, a comment or better...a story before you leave. 
I love stories.

FLANDERS TODAY a flemish online newspaper has published an article about us and about Airbnb:
“In the last year we’ve had 60 or so guests staying with us at home,” says Fronk, who, with his partner Lieve, is one of the best-rated Flemish hosts on Airbnb, a hotel-like service for the digital age. “We have had guests from Brazil, the US, Canada, Iran, Japan, Bulgaria and more. Though no one from Africa has yet requested to stay.” 
Airbnb is an online marketplace for temporary accommodation across 33,000 cities in 192 countries. Trip planners can find spare rooms, flats, sofa-beds and even igloos and private islands. Some hosts are simply renting out a spare room for a couple of weeks a month to travellers to supplement their incomes or to fill the house when they themselves are away. 
Airbnb is in the vanguard of the so-called “sharing economy”, in which web services help private individuals monetise their possessions and share anything from school runs to electric drills. Flanders has more than 900 listings on the site. 
Connections 
Fronk and Lieve say that their guests have loved Antwerp and always have a good time. Yet if a number of their guests are visiting for tourism, many are in town for less conventional reasons. One was interviewing for a job at the opera house. Another was doing a course with world-famous contemporary artist Jan Fabre, while a third was studying with a leading dancer. A medievalist stayed for several weeks to learn Dutch for her research, while a Canadian rock band crashed when gigging down the road. 
Connecting with new people with different world views is one of the attractions, as is discovering a unexpected shared interest. “The other day I was having a bowl of soup with one of our guests, who had just arrived from the United States,” recalls Fronk. “To our surprise, we soon discovered that we were both working on essays on the same subject.” Fronk, who is a literary translator of Russian and a performer, and Lieve, an organist and soprano, say that in their year of hosting they have yet to have a bad experience. Some guests stay several weeks, some come back for a second or third visit. “But we make it clear on the website that we are vegetarians, that we do yoga and that this is a family house,” Fronk explains. This attracts people who are into the same things (and probably discourages those who want to spend their time exploring Antwerp’s party scene). 
Peer reviews 
Fronk and Lieve live in Borgerhout, a neighbourhood with a large immigrant population just east of the city’s Central Station, which is visible from their balcony. Borgerhout itself does not house many attractions and enjoys a reputation for being a rough sort of place. But guests have never had any problems, says Fronk. Indeed, he wistfully recalls a middle-aged American visitor looking out of the window at the district where Fronk grew up and declaring it a beautiful place. 
Importantly for guests, the area provides easy access by foot or bike to Antwerp’s main sites, including the zoo; elephants can be heard vaguely trumpeting from the flat’s balcony.

We are expats (a Canadian and a Belgian) who spent almost two decades living and working abroad.   Our favourite country was Namibia where we enjoyed 8 fabulous years, followed closely by Brooklyn, New York, and now we're retired in Malta (which we love!).  We are so fortunate and grateful for the many amazing adventures we've enjoyed and for all of the wonderful and loving friends we've made all over the world.  

If you want more information about us, you can check out the book I wrote in Namibia as a fund-raiser for a charity I support, just to prove to you I'm authentic.   Search for Danette Jaeb - Walk a Mile in My Shoes.  I also have a website that you can find if you search for me.

We are trying our hands at hosting our apartments if and when they are available.  Bear with us as we learn how to become Airbnb hosts.   We don't have many ratings yet since we have friends often staying at our studio but have decided to take a more serious stab at this now.  

Thank you all.

I'm born and raised in Antwerp and I hope to be able to welcome you here. 
What I really love about the city is that it has everything you need but its still cosy and small so you can do everything by foot or bike. 
I'm born to a dutch father and brazilian mom and like to learn new languages and learn new cultures. I'm fluent in English, Dutch and Portuguese  and can speak a bit of french, spanish and german. Its nice that I can practice these languages some more while hosting! 
One of my Biggest passions is music and I'm lucky to be able to work with it.

PHILOSOPHY

When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down 'happy'. They told me I didn't understand the assignment, and I told them they didn't understand life. - 
John Lennon
